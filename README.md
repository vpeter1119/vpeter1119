### Hello, I'm Peter. Welcome to my GitHub profile! 👋
Ever since I switched careers from public administration to the telecommunications sector I recognized that IT and development in general really suits my abilities. So a few years ago I have started learning the basics of web development then began to work on personal open-source projects that I cared about.

# ✔️ What I learned so far
- JavaScript, ES6, Typescript
- Frontend JS frameworks (Angular)
- Creating responsive layout with [Angular flex-layout](https://github.com/angular/flex-layout)
- CSS libraries (Angular Material, Materialize)
- Backend JS frameworks (Node.js and Express)
- NoSQL database (MongoDB)
- Major JS libraries (e.g. jQuery, rxjs, Moment.js, lodash, Leaflet)
- C# and Unity
- Agile development using Jira
- Inkscape
- Documentation (General principles as well as various tools for editing xml-based documents)

# 📘 What I'm currently practicing / learning
- Swagger (OpenAPI)
- Unit testing with Jest
- CD/CI
- Creating 3D models and materials with Blender

# ⭐ My active projects
- A CRUD application that helps me with the monthly report of meter and calculation of overhead expenses
  - [Frontend (Angular)](https://github.com/vpeter1119/biborrezsi-server)
  - [Server (Node.js)](https://github.com/vpeter1119/biborrezsi-frontend)
- [Interactive fantasy maps (Angular and Leaflet)](https://github.com/vpeter1119/fantasy-maps-angular)
